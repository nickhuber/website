:summary: 8/10 - More to kill and more to explore

The first, and likely only, expansion to Monster Hunter World delivers on its
goal of adding more locations, monsters and game play mechanics to the base
game. It doesn't add any new weapon types but every weapon is given a new move,
and a new tool, the clutch claw, is at your disposal to help take down the monsters.

The story is nothing special, there are only so many ways the same story can be
told with the same outcome but the story is not the reason to play this game.

8/10 - If you enjoyed Monster Hunter World then the odds are that you will like
the expansion.
