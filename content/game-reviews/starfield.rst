:summary: 4/10 - An empty and repetitive universe

Starfield is a game massive in scale that feels smaller than the previous elder
scrolls and fallout games. It allegedly has 1000 planets spread over 100 star
systems; but the planets all feel the same and have the same selection of
hostile alien monsters, facilities and/or caves so it just feels like the same
planet reskinned a few times and given a few random tweaks.

Despite the size of the universe you can explore; most of the missions revolve
around just 3 major hub cities, and a handful of smaller towns. This makes
everything feel even smaller since despite the huge breadth of space available
everything always loops back through the same locations.

Exploring and scanning minerals and lifeforms on the various planets feels
pointless; as all the planets either look to be currently occupied with ships
constantly landing or have previously been occupied and have since been
abandoned with old factories and research stations appearing all over.

NPCs constantly find themselves inside the floor or ceiling. In one of the main
cities, Neon, I would frequently see guards slowly floating up into the ceiling,
never to be seen again. One time an NPC I had to turn a quest into would fall
the floor as I approached him, making the quest non-completable. I had to take a
long detour to approach him from another direction to avoid this from issue.

Managing resources is a huge pain, even with maxing out the increased inventory
capacity perk first, I would constantly find myself overburdened with materials.
I would even fill up my space ship's hold with materials and have to keep adding
on more storage compartments to make room for more things.

The combat is easy, with a fairly small selection of weapon types. I never even
found a single particle rifle in my entire 87 hours with the game. You unlock
some powers through the main story but other than some that help you move around
a bit quicker they aren't really that helpful since nothing is ever a challenge.

The main story is pretty boring and repetitive, mostly travelling to various
caves to find an artifact, and then later travel to various temples to solve the
exact same zero gravity "puzzle" and unlock a new power.

Travelling anywhere sucks with lots of cutscenes (likely hiding loading screens)
of things like your space ship taking off or landing, or docking/undocking from
something. I would try to batch as many things up in an area as I could to avoid
hitting the huge delay in travel incurred from all these cutscenes.

NPCs constantly shuffle around in conversations and either end up `glitching into
objects`_ and flickering around, right up in your face or in another room entirely
as the camera faces a wall.

I wrote this review more than a month since playing it last; so the only lasting
impressions on the game seem to have been negative.

Score
------

4/10 - A very forgettable experience that probably isn't worth your time.
