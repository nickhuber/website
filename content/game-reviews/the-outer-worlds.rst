:summary: 7/10 - A unique world that doesn't quite meet its potential

I had high hopes when starting The Outer Worlds, and they were met for while.

Unfortunately the game never ventures far from it's initial concept, and its
predictable story and annoying characters didn't help keep me engaged. I played
on the hardest difficulty, and after feeling pretty satisfied with the pace of
the game on the first planet it seemed to be quite easy to become overpowered as
you ventured further. The game hardly ever presented any sort of meaningful
danger.

7/10 - A neat new experience that doesn't quite live up to the hype from the
creators of Fallout: New Vegas.
