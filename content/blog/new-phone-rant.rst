:summary: I got a new phone and I think its worse than my old phone

About a month ago, I replaced my Pixel 3 phone with a Pixel 7. The battery in my
Pixel 3 would no longer last a day, and the USB port was broken, so I figured it might
be time for an upgrade. So far, I have not been thrilled with my new Pixel 7
and preferred the old phone in almost every way.

Camera
-------

My understanding is the camera sensor hasn't changed which seems a bit
disappointing since this is my only camera, but maybe the lenses are better and
there is probably more post-processing going on, so perhaps the pictures are
supposed to be higher quality, but they all seem to turn out darker. The night
shots do seem to look nicer, though.

The bump for the cameras on the back of the phone is ridiculous in size and has
sharp edges. I was hoping to avoid putting a case on the phone, but it was
impossible to hold comfortably with the camera setup. I'm fairly certain I would
prefer the phone be a constant thickness; maybe fit a larger battery in or a
3.5mm audio jack or something.

The front-facing camera is also slotted into the screen, which is ugly
and annoying as there is a black circular void on the display if anything tries
to use it full screen.

Biometric unlock
-----------------

I find that the face unlock is the least reliable feature on the phone. Because it
exists, I always try to use it and I have been growing increasingly frustrated at
watching it fail to detect my face in all but ideal lighting scenarios. I think
I'll disable this feature to avoid waiting for it to fail and trying
another unlock strategy.

The fingerprint sensor was moved from the back of the phone to the front, under
the screen using some sort of witchcraft, I assume. I always had a few failures
reading my fingerprint on the Pixel 3, but on the Pixel 7 not only do the
failures seem more frequent; but because it is under the screen it is not always
available as an option so if I "swipe up" from the lock screen, I lose the
ability to enter my fingerprint as it is showing me a prompt for a PIN instead.
With the Pixel 3 dedicated fingerprint reader you could still enter a
fingerprint to unlock in this scenario. It was always kind of convenient to be
able to unlock the Pixel 3 without touching the screen.

In short, unlocking my phone has made me more frustrated and I almost always
have to enter my PIN now.

Speakers
---------

The Pixel 3 has two front-facing speakers, one below the screen and one above.
This made it a great device for watching media as the sound was of decent
quality and volume and was directed towards your face. The Pixel 7 has a speaker
on the bottom of the phone so not only is the sound quieter, and isn't directed
to the person trying to consume it but it is very easy to cover with your hand
while holding the phone in landscape, as I like to do when watching videos.

Conclusion
-----------

I think this phone is worse in nearly every regard than phone it replaces.
Perhaps I should have tried to get the battery and USB port replaced.
