Who am I?
----------

I'm a guy who loves programming, especially in Linux. If you want to contact me
for any reason, I have catch-all email set up for this domain so it should be
pretty easy.


Programming
------------

I've been programming since secondary school, where I focused on making games
of which I have lost the all the sources to. After finishing some
post-secondary schooling at BCIT_, I have been more interested in web
technologies like Django and VueJS. I also have a strong interest in computer
networks, possibly related to some previous work at an SD-WAN vendor or from my
focus on network programming at BCIT.

I currently work at Tucows_, as a software engineer for `Ting Internet`_.

Gaming
-------

I'm an avid PC gamer, across many genres. Role-playing games are probably my
favourite with things like *Baldur's Gate* and *Divinity: Original Sin 2* being
very memorable experiences.

I like to hunt for achievements when I play games, and have linked up Exophase_
to track the various systems I have earned achievements throughout.

YouTube
--------

I sometimes like to make kind of silly `YouTube videos`_ about some of the
games I play. I think its fun to learn a little bit about video editing.
