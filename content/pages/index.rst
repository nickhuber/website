Who am I?
----------

I'm a guy who loves programming, especially in Linux. If you want to contact me
for any reason, I have catch-all email set up for this domain so it should be
pretty easy.


Programming
------------

At my current employer I work on making an SD-WAN networking appliance that
runs on Linux using commodity hardware. It lets me see many new problems and
technologies that I might otherwise miss out on.


Gaming
-------

I'm an avid PC gamer, across many genres. Role-playing games are probably my
favourite with things like *Baldur's Gate* and *Divinity: Original Sin 2* being
very memorable experiences.

I like to hunt for achievements when I play games, and have linked up Exophase_
to track the various systems I have earned achievements throughout.

YouTube
--------

I like to make kind of silly YouTube videos about some of the games I play
sometimes. I think its fun to learn a little bit about video editing.
