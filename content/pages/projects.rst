These are some projects of my own I have worked on.

PACT
-----

It stands for **\ P**\ latform **\ A**\ gnostic **\ C**\ ombat **\ T**\ racker,
although I've only ever used it with Pathfinder and D&D 5th edition. It should
work fine for any tabletop gaming system that has the concept of initiative,
and hit points.

It's goal is to give something simple to help a DM manage encounters while
still being out of the way enough to not bring too much technology to the table
during game nights.

I use Django for the database management and serving an API powered by Django
REST Framework. The frontend is a pretty simple Vuejs with Axios to handle the
requests.

I am very happy with how it works right now, and am looking forward to adding
more features to it. It is my first project that I have actually managed to get
users for, even if it is just my friends.


Joke websites
--------------

For some laughs at work I have made some dumb websites.
